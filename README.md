### Requirements

- Tested with Unity 2020.3.26f1, though it will likely work in earlier versions too

### Limitations

- I mainly focused on developing this package for my own use cases which are geared towards PC and Mac deployment. As such, some steps of the SDK Initializaiton and Login process have been skipped and definitions for more advanced configurations are not yet available. These are relatively easy to update, so if you have need of more options in the EOSCore feel free to let me know.
